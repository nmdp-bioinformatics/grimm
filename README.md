# Walkthrough

### 1. Generate Initial Graph
 Follow [Graph Generation](graph_generator/README.md) to generate haplotype frequency CSV files and import to Neo4j.


### 2. Perform Imputation
 Follow [Imputation](multi_race_impute/README.md) directions to produce imputation results from frequency files.


### 3. Perform Matching
  Follow [Match Validation](matching/README.md) to perform matching and compare against consensus results.
